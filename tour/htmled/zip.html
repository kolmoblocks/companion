<h1>Deploying custom encoding/compression algorithm</h1>

<p>KolmoLD allows for delivering the data along with the code to decode it.</p>

<p>That means being able to support custom or brand new files formats in short time without waiting implementation in the browsers.</p>

<p>For example, new modern image format WebP does&rsquo;t supported in all browsers, insted of jpeg. For that case you can create a WebAssembly transcoder
for converting WebP to jpeg on client side in browser there it needed.</p>
