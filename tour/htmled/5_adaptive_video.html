<h1>How KolmoLD can benefit streaming media</h1>

<p>KolmoLD can also be applied to streaming media.
Suppose we are streaming a video at 360p off of a site that uses adaptive bitrate streaming.
Our buffer will hold a few 360p frames to prevent stalling. Once the video player detects that our network could support 720p, our 360p frames in buffer will be discarded.</p>

<p>With the help of KolmoLD, we can avoid having to discard the buffered frames.
Data expressions provide many ways for us to formulate our desired higher resolution frame.</p>

<p>In this example, we would like to upgrade our 360p BMP to 720p BMP.
Two data expressions are provided to formulate the 720p BMP:
1. Directly downloading the 720p image
2. Using a web assembly module that takes in both resolutions and uses the difference of them to build the higher resolution BMP from the lower resolution BMP</p>
